PRESERVING COLLAGEN

It's not only about avoiding wrinkles and creases. As a person
ages, the shape of their face changes as well. Therefore, keeping the skin firm
and continually strengthening facial muscles via massage, drinking plenty of
water, using a good serum, and having a healthy diet are all necessary things
to consider. 

Unfortunately, some things are inevitable. Cells break down.
Collagen depletes. Elastin diminishes. Skin loses plumpness. These are some of
the reasons one's face-shape changes and why the above suggestions are crucial
for maintaining firmness and a healthy-looking glow.

Facial massage

If you'd rather not pay someone else to massage your face,
you can do this yourself. For best results, perform this once daily, or at
least several times a week. This will increase blood flow and supply the blood
evenly throughout the entire face, which will ultimately help to maintain
collagen. Facial massage is necessary for toning and firming. To avoid any kind
of friction, the application of a lubricant, such as massage cream or even your
daily moisturizer, is a good idea. Pressing too firmly can damage the elastin
fibers in the skin, but adding too little pressure will not be effective at all.
Massage each square inch in small circles. Some areas (like the nose) may be
difficult to massage, but the idea is to simply cause the muscles beneath the
skin to move and stay active. Try not to move the surface of the skin much. On
these difficult areas, any type of movement on the skin will work. Anywhere
from 8 to 10 repetitions should be sufficient. 

Because the skin of the eye area is more delicate, apply very
little pressure, try especially not to pull on this skin, and use fewer
repetitions of massage movements. Use 'The Less' rule: less time (repetitions),
less movement, and less pressure. My philosophy: we exercise our bodies, so why
not our faces? ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/137a3fa5229cbc1a285707c2e312b558bbd6157d.jpg)

H2O

Because approximately 75% of Americans are chronically
dehydrated, the consumption of water is greatly encouraged. Drinking at least nine
cups per day (approximately) can subdue fine lines, as well as give the face a softer,
more moisturized feel and appearance. The water we ingest first nourishes our
inner parts (blood, organs, bones etc.) and any extra water is supplied to our
skin. This is why it is so important to drink lots of water. 

The consumption of water also helps to maintain the balance
of body fluids and to heal wounds, it helps to support the distribution of
caloric intake, it helps to energize muscles, it helps to maintain skin's
appearance, it helps to maintain the kidneys, and it helps to maintain normal
bowel function, among other things. Water is both beneficial and necessary for
ingestion, so why not give your skin a drink too?

Serum

Using a serum daily is crucial for the maintenance of
collagen. Serum is a product that should be applied after cleansing, after
toner, and before moisturizer. This is usually a thin, liquid-like substance
that can easily penetrate the skin's outer layers. Serum helps with firming and
supports collagen.
